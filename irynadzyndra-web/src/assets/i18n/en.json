  "aboutFirstP": "A representative of modern trends of the fine and decorative arts artist. In her works  places emphasis on the,process of  creating an image, on interdependence of the artist and the painting and vice versa,  when most fully theopportunities for retranslation of the emotional-imaginative groundwork are materialized. The themes of the author’sartistic expression most often are revealed in a landscape, her own vision of the landscape and space where itspreads with all the finest nuances of its emotional coloring. Contemplation, dialogue, meditation are the priority principles of the contextual filling of the artist’s works picturesqueness.",

  "linesText": "Line: dash, stripe, limit, length, straight, a geometric object by definition. Line outlines the boundaries, indicates the direction, determines the order. Skylines, borders of the countries, personal boundaries, borders of common sense. One would think that the structure is well-defined. How inviolable and how imaginary is it however? Lines on canvases build composition, form visions, demonstrate and illustrate ideas; processes of finding answers, understanding the environment, and self-awareness. Perhaps the most important questions are rhetorical, and perhaps they are obviously simple… Perhaps the very thinking of this is the answer…",

  "seineText": "a series of oil paintings on canvas. Sketches of Paris inspired by the book of memoirs of Ernest Hemingway “The moveable Feast”. Without intending to illustrate the book but willing to transmit the feeling of sensations and emotions, the mood of the city. Paris, with its streets, buildings and gardens,  parks and squares, shops, coffee bars, embankments, the Seine river – enchants  and does not let you go. Abundance of art in every fragment, beauty of everyday life in every corner. In the bright sun and in the soft twilight, noise, aromas – opens up in its way to everyone the ideal, most romantic city in the world. Reflecting in the Seine  the city becomes especially mysterious. The very Parisian aura of poetic sentiment, flickering exquisiteness, some hypnotic enchantment come to light. Without clear contours, richly decorated with sparkles of rippled water, the city is flirting and playing  with the river and the river carries away all its secrets.",
